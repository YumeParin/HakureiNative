# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

# BY MYSELF YUMEPARIN

This template project represent a perfect setup, with tailwind well enabled
I followed the tutorial (https://youtu.be/f8Z9JyB2EIE) to make to setup and also the website (https://www.nativewind.dev/docs/getting-started/installation) for the Nativewind side

Sure, you'll want to go to the React Native

If you want to use the reactNative here, I personnaly used like in the earlier mentionned tuto, web storm
I also used android studio to connect my phone to the PC, and downloaded the samsung to window driver here (https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb) so my phone and PC can communitcate ? and also allow usb debugging in the DEV setting in your phone

then after all that and following the page (https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb) you can open android studio and plug your phone to the PC, open/create a new projecto n android studio that you will not use and you will normaly be able to see and use your phone from android studio

## Basic Commands

Install dependencies

```pwsh
npm install
```

Run expo (options: --clear, --tunnel)

```pwsh
npx expo start --clear --tunnel
//--tunnel is to have "on-save" refresh on you plugged phone WHEN your PC and Phone aren't on the same network
//--clear is like to start withtout old data or cache, it's better to always use it I guess
```
